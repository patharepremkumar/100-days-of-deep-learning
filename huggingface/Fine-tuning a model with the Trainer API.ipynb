        "2. Note that to use the internal loss you’ll need to pass your labels as part of the input, not as a separate label, which is the normal way to use labels with Keras models. You’ll see examples of this in Part 2 of the course, where defining the correct loss function can be tricky. For sequence classification, however, a standard Keras loss function works fine, so that’s what we’ll use here."
